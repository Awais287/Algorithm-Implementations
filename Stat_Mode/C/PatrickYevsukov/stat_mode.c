// I devised this algorithm to identify the statistical mode or 
// modes of a dataset. It requires one pass through the set to 
// identify the set's mode or modes.

// This algorithm works by keeping track of the number of times a
// unique value occurs in the set. If a unique value has occurred
// more times than the ones before it, it is added to the list of
// modes. As the loop continues all values which occur this number
// of times are added to the list of modes, unless another unique
// value occurs more times than the currently identified modes. If
// this happens, the mode array indexing variable is reset to zero
// and the previously identified values are overwritten by the new
// modes. When finished, the mode array indexing variable will be
// one less than the number of modes.

// This algorithm requires a set of values in which all instances
// of a unique value are listed next to one another.
